## Code of Conduct

### Introduction

The contributors to this project are  professionals and volunteers from all over the world. Diversity is
one of our strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and disharmony within projects. To
that end, several protocols have been implemented that participants must adhere to. This document
outlines expectations for participation in this project, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable
behavior. It is not an exhaustive list of prohibited behaviors. Rather, it should be seen as a guide to
make all participants more productive and collaborative.

Participation in the project constitutes agreement to this Code of Conduct.

### Project Governance

* The project creators constitute the managing members of the project and have final say in every
  decision of the project, technical or otherwise, including overruling previous decisions.
* All members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want within the project.
* Authority or position in the project will be proportional to the accrued contribution.
* Software is evolutive; better implementations must supersede lesser implementations. Technical
  advantage is the primary evaluation metric.
* Topics outside of the project, including non-technical conflicts, must be discussed in a separate
  space.  Disruption of the project will not be tolerated.

### Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to:

* **Be welcoming;** our community welcomes people of all backgrounds. We believe that communities made up
  of people with diverse experiences improve the overall technical quality of the project.
* **Discuss or debate the idea, not the person;** individual characteristics, including but not limited
  to: body, sex, sexual preference, race, gender, language, religion, nationality, or political
  preferences are irrelevant to the scope of the project and will not be taken into account concerning
  the value of any contributor or contributions to the project. Non-technical conflicts related to these
  topics should be discussed in a separate space.
* **Understand disagreements;** disagreements can be useful learning opportunities for all parties
  involved. Seek to understand other viewpoints and resolve technical differences constructively.
* **Be respectful;** we are a community of professionals and volunteers, and we conduct ourselves
  professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and
  unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  * The use of violent, sexually-explicit, discriminatory, or derogatory language to refer to any person
    or group of people.
  * Sharing or otherwise transmitting someone's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Advocating for, making threats to, or otherwise encouraging any of the above behaviors.
  * *Keep discussions focused;* no objectives beyond the stated objectives of this project are relevant
    to the project. Any intent to deviate the project from its original purpose of existence will
    constitute grounds for remedial action.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct governs the technical procedures of the project, not the activities outside of it.
The Code applies to this repository and any communication which occurs therein. It additionally applies
in any context where a project member is explicitly acting on behalf of the project, which includes but
is not limited to:

* Using an official e-mail address or other communication channel.
* Acting as an appointed representative of the project in an online or offline event.

### Issue Resolution Process

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by contacting one of the project's creators. In your
report, please include:

1. Your contact information.
2. Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses,
   please include them as well.
3. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
   available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or
   attachment.
4. Any additional information that may be helpful.

Complaints will be reviewed and investigated fairly and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, we may seek
insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting
the incident will be kept at all times.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages
in unacceptable behavior, we may take action we deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the
project.

### Addenda

#### Why have a Code of Conduct?

People and communities are the foundation of open source. Projects thrive through diversity of thought
and the safety of its members. We want all participants to enjoy a culture of mutual respect and
responsibility. While conduct issues seldom arise, when they do, they are often very public and very
passionate. It is best for the community to be prepared with:

* A clear and accessible Code of Conduct stating the norms under which projects operate.
* An Issue Resolution Process for addressing cases where these norms are not being maintained.

#### Why this Code of Conduct?

This Code of Conduct is derived from Roberto Rosario's Code of Merit, the TODO Group Code of Conduct
template, and others. The project creators believe this Code of Conduct encapsulates the values that
will best lead to the project's success.

#### Can I use this Code of Conduct in my project?

Yes. The document is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license. You will of course need to update the
document to suit the specifics of your project, but by all means use this however you can to drive great
communities.
